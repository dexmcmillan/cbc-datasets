# Datasets in Canada
 A collection of solid datasets to use for graphics or anything else.

### Wildfire data
- Natural Resources Canada (NRCAN)
    - [All](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/downloads/)
    - [Active wildfires](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/downloads/activefires)
    - [Hotspots (perimeters)](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/downloads/hotspots/)
    - [Hotspots (points)](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/downloads/hotspots/)

        From NRCAN: "A hotspot is a satellite image pixel with high infrared intensity, indicating a heat source. Hotspots from known industrial sources are removed; the remaining hotspots represent vegetation fires, which can be in forest, grass, cropland, or logging debris. A hotspot may represent one fire or be one of several hotspots representing a larger fire. Not all fires can be identified from satellite imagery, either because the fires are too small or because cloud cover obscures the satellite's view of the ground."
