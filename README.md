# Datasets in Canada
A collection of solid datasets to use for graphics or anything else.

Wildfire data
* Natural Resources Canada (NRCAN)
    * [All](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/downloads/)
    * [Active wildfires](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/downloads/activefires/activefires.csv)
    * [Wildfire perimeters]
    * [Hotspots](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/downloads/hotspots/)

        From NRCAN: "A hotspot is a satellite image pixel with high infrared intensity, indicating a heat source. Hotspots from known industrial sources are removed; the remaining hotspots represent vegetation fires, which can be in forest, grass, cropland, or logging debris. A hotspot may represent one fire or be one of several hotspots representing a larger fire. Not all fires can be identified from satellite imagery, either because the fires are too small or because cloud cover obscures the satellite's view of the ground."

* BC Wildfire Centre
    * [ArcGIS servers](https://services6.arcgis.com/ubm4tcTYICKBpist/arcgis/rest/services/)
        A wealth of different ArcGis map servers to do with weather, wildfires, and other interesting stuff.


Labour and demographics
* [Labour Force Survey](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/dtl!downloadDbLoadingData-nonTraduit.action?pid=1410028701&latestN=5&startDate=&endDate=&csvLocale=en&selectedMembers=%5B%5B1%5D%2C%5B1%2C2%2C3%2C4%2C5%2C6%2C7%2C8%2C9%5D%2C%5B1%5D%2C%5B1%5D%2C%5B1%5D%2C%5B1%2C3%5D%5D&checkedLevels=)
