## WILDFIRES

### Natural Resources Canada wildfire data
Data on hotspots, active wildfires, and wildfire progression polygons.

From NRCAN: "A hotspot is a satellite image pixel with high infrared intensity, indicating a heat source. Hotspots from known industrial sources are removed; the remaining hotspots represent vegetation fires, which can be in forest, grass, cropland, or logging debris. A hotspot may represent one fire or be one of several hotspots representing a larger fire. Not all fires can be identified from satellite imagery, either because the fires are too small or because cloud cover obscures the satellite's view of the ground."

### NOAA hurricane data
Lots of data here showing the historical path of hurricanes and their probable paths. The data disappears when the hurricane is gone, so be aware of that. The data can be accessed through XML when there is a warning up on the link below.
