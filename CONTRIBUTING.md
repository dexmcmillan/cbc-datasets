# How to contribute

Have something you want to add? Fork and submit a pull request! If the dataset you'd like to see added is something that is updated regularly, please add a link to the README.md file rather than pushing it as a static file.

Please ensure you're okay with all the data you add being public, as this is a public repository that anyone can use.
